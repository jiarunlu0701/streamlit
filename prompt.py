            • Open Source Licenses
            • Inner Source
            Additionally, we’ll share our experience about open source &  security from our HANA development daily practice.
            
            DEAR COLLEGUES，
            In Labs China d-com 2023, Juergen and Ruicheng announced go-live of Labs China BTP applications, which drew a wonderful conclusion of Labs China Digital Transformation Program we launched last year. This program is not just about internal adoption, it’s also about learning by doing. We have 50+ colleagues from different LoBs participated in this program. They are the ones who really made things happen. They also gain a lot of experiences by working on BTP, mostly for the first time. Now it’s time to share their best practices to more Labs China colleagues.
            We will organize four sessions with various topics, such as CAP, OP migration to BTP, WeCom integration, etc. Please register according to your interest, and your learning hours will be recorded in SuccessMap.
            Part 1: Best Practice of AI on BTP@AlibabaCloud
            Yongyuan Shen; Steven Lu
            The Digital Access project migrates a legacy OP solution that includes face recognition as an AI feature to the BTP platform. During this process, we have been experimenting with the best practices for AI on BTP. In order to deliver a BTP product with AI features, we need to think more deeply about our approach. Let's explore best practices together by examining a real case study of AI on the Cloud.
            Part 2: How we handle GDPR Compliance for employee data process in Travel Tracking
            Speaker: Liu Ji
            SAP values data protection as essential and is fully committed to complying with regulations – including the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and China's Data Protection and Privacy Laws and Regulations. In this session, I’m going to briefly share a few core experience that how travel tracking handles GDPR and related regulations in China. (e.g. simplify deletion of personal data, report on existing data and identified data, restrict access to personal data, log read access to personal data, etc.)


            亲爱的同事们,

            SAP多年来一直在进行云转型，针对SAP现有云产品，开发人员也被要求使用行业级的云原生知识及技能对其进行更新。为了更好的赋能员工，Digital School与GeekBang合作，结合SAP Development Learning团队在提升员工云原生能力方面的经验，整合外部行业优质资源，为大家带来10场一流的云原生趋势和最佳案例讲座，包括前端技术、后端开发、AI、云计算、微服务设计等主题。

            我们非常注重用户体验反馈，在Web开发中，服务器端编程能高效地分发为个人用户定制的信息，从而创造更佳的用户体验，所以在第四场分享邀请到在架构、数据库设计有深度研究的李振东，给大家分享《Web程序集服务器端》，希望能给大家带来更多工作中的启发。

            Dear colleagues,
            UX Basics training is so popular and in-demand that we're constantly getting requests to offer it. We're excited to announce that we'll be offering Offline UX Basics training in September at Shanghai Labs! If you are interested or involved in user experience design, please don’t miss this opportunity and register without hesitation.
            This course gives a basic understanding of usability as it is lived in SAP. You get to know the complete user experience process starting from planning and research to use cases, designing mock-ups and usability testing. There are many practical examples and exercises which are introduced by theoretical units. It is intended for non-UX-professionals, e.g. developers, UA, translators, PO, etc. and is a plus for everybody who is involved in creating applications.
            
            Dear Colleagues,
